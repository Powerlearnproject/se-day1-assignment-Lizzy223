- Customization: IDEs often support extensions and plugins, allowing developers to customize their environment to better fit their needs and workflow.

 VCS:
- Version Tracking: VCS tools like Git track changes to code over time. This allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code, compare changes, and understand the evolution of a project.
- Collaboration: VCS systems facilitate collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. They manage merging changes and resolve conflicts, ensuring that contributions from different team members are integrated smoothly.
- Branching and Merging: VCS systems support branching, allowing developers to work on features or fixes in isolation before merging them back into the main codebase. This helps in managing different versions of the project and experimenting without disrupting the main line of development.
- Audit Trails: VCS maintains a history of changes, including who made each change and why. This audit trail is useful for tracking down issues, understanding decision-making processes, and ensuring accountability.
- Backup and Recovery**: By storing code in a version control repository, developers have a backup of their work. This protects against data loss and provides a way to recover from errors or failures.

Together, IDEs and VCS tools greatly enhance the efficiency, quality, and manageability of software development, making them indispensable in modern development workflows.

7.
